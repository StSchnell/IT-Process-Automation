# IT Process Automation

IT process automation automates repeatable business processes and workflows to reduce manual tasks and increase efficiency. It is a wider, business-oriented approach that focuses on automating processes across the entire enterprise. Data center automation on the other hand is a specific form of IT automation that is limited to the technical level of the IT infrastructure in the data center. 

This repository looks at some developer perspectives of IT process automation with Red Hat Ansible.

## Ansible
